## Examples
### Preferred:
"Subject: Network Configuration Update - Response Needed by Friday

Dear James,

The recent security audit has identified potential vulnerabilities in our cloud network configuration. These issues affect three critical systems:

The authentication gateway requires updated TLS certificates by next week. Our testing shows the current certificates use deprecated encryption standards that could be compromised.

Can you review the proposed changes by Friday at 3 PM? I have attached the technical specifications document for your reference.

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
Simon"

### Avoid:
"Subject: Updates

Hey there,

Just wanted to touch base about some stuff that's come up with the network project. The security guys aren't happy with some things and want changes which is obviously going to impact when we can deliver everything, so I was thinking maybe we should look at adjusting some of the dates that we had previously discussed.

Let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Cheers!"
