## Examples
### Preferred:
"Subject: Project Timeline Update - Response Needed by Friday

Hi James,

The marketing team has requested changes to the website design. These changes will affect our timeline:

• Homepage redesign: extended by 3 days
• Product pages: no change
• Checkout flow: reduced by 2 days

Can you confirm if this works for your team by Friday at 3 PM?

Thanks,
Simon"

### Avoid:
"Subject: Updates

Hey there,

Just wanted to touch base about some stuff that's come up with the website project. The marketing people aren't happy with some things and want changes which is obviously going to impact when we can deliver everything, so I was thinking maybe we should look at adjusting some of the dates that we had previously discussed.

Let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Cheers!"
