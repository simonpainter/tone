# Slide Deck Tone Guide

## Style Elements
- Use UK English spellings and grammar.
- Embrace brevity - use 30 words or fewer per slide when possible.
- Use bullet points only where needed for clarity and conciseness.
- Employ the "6x6 rule" - no more than 6 bullet points per slide, no more than 6 words per bullet.
- Use clear, jargon-free language except when industry terminology is expected.
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the presentation.
- Use plain text formatting to allow for custom visual styling in presentation software.
- Avoid contractions in formal presentations (use "we are" instead of "we're").
- Use "we" rather than "I" to represent your organization or team.

## Emotional Tone

## Phrases to Use
- "Our analysis shows..."
- "The data indicates..."
- "Key takeaways include..."
- "To summarize..."
- "This matters because..."
- "Our measurements demonstrate..."

## Phrases to Avoid
- "As you can see" (assume they can)
- "Obviously" or "clearly" (could make audience feel unintelligent)
- "I think" or "I believe" (undermines authority)
- "Game-changing" or "revolutionary" (overused buzzwords)

- Support key points with specific data and statistics

## Examples
### Preferred:
"Title: Q3 Cloud Network Performance

Network latency reduced 24% since Q2
