## Examples
### Preferred:
"Based on customer research conducted in February 2025, 72% of our target market prioritizes network security over performance optimization. We recommend investing £250,000 in advanced threat detection systems over the next 6 months. This approach will:

Reduce security incidents by approximately 47% according to our testing in comparable environments. This represents a potential cost avoidance of £1.2M annually based on our current incident response costs.

Align with our data protection commitments and upcoming regulatory requirements. Our legal team confirms this will position us to be fully compliant with the EU NIS2 Directive taking effect in 2026.

Address a key competitive disadvantage identified in the KPMG market analysis (see Appendix B).

The primary risks include supply chain disruptions affecting hardware availability (medium probability) and integration challenges with legacy systems (high probability). We have developed mitigation strategies for both scenarios."

### Avoid:
"It is abundantly clear that moving forward we need to leverage our world-class capabilities to create a truly groundbreaking security initiative that will disrupt the market and create unprecedented synergies across our value chain. By thinking outside the box and implementing a best-in-class approach to threat detection, we will undoubtedly see massive improvements in customer perception as well as substantial cost reductions, not to mention the extraordinary competitive advantage we will gain over our less forward-thinking competitors in the marketplace."
