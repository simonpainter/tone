## Examples
### Preferred:
"Based on customer research conducted in February 2025, 72% of our target market prioritizes sustainability in purchasing decisions. We recommend investing £250,000 in sustainable packaging development over the next 6 months. This approach will:

• Reduce packaging costs by approximately 18%
• Align with our environmental commitments
• Address a key competitive disadvantage
• Position us effectively for the EU regulatory changes in 2026

The primary risks include supply chain disruptions (medium probability) and higher initial unit costs (high probability)."

### Avoid:
"It is abundantly clear that moving forward we need to leverage our world-class capabilities to create a truly groundbreaking sustainability initiative that will disrupt the market and create unprecedented synergies across our value chain. By thinking outside the box and implementing a best-in-class approach to packaging, we will undoubtedly see massive improvements in customer perception as well as substantial cost reductions, not to mention the extraordinary competitive advantage we will gain over our less forward-thinking competitors in the marketplace."
