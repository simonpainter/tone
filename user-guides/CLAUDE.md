## Examples
### Preferred:
"## Creating Your First Project

In this section, you'll learn how to create a new project and set up the basic structure.

### What You'll Need
- An active account (free or paid)
- About 5 minutes
- A project name in mind

### Steps

1. Log in to your account at app.example.com

2. Click the '+ New Project' button in the top right corner.
   ![New Project button highlighted with a red circle in the top navigation bar](/images/new-project-button.png)

3. Enter your project name in the "Project Title" field.
   
   The system automatically generates a project ID based on your title. You can change this if you prefer a different ID.

4. Select a template from the dropdown menu or choose "Blank Project" to start from scratch.

5. Click "Create Project".

Your new project will open in the editor. If this is your first time using the editor, a quick tutorial will appear to help you get started.

### Troubleshooting

If the project doesn't create successfully:
- Check that your project title doesn't contain special characters (only letters, numbers, and spaces are allowed)
- Verify that you have fewer than 10 active projects on a free account
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

### Try It Yourself
Create a new project called "My Test Project" using the Blog template. Once created, locate the main navigation panel on the left side."

### Avoid:
"## Projects

Creating projects is super easy! Just click the button and fill in the form. It's really simple and you'll have your project ready in no time!

Obviously you need to be logged in first. Then just find the new project button (it's clearly visible at the top) and click it. Then you simply fill in a name - make sure it's a good one! Then just pick a template (or don't, whatever you want!) and hit the button. Boom! You're done!

If it doesn't work you probably did something wrong. Check everything and try again. It's really not complicated at all, so you should get it working without any issues."
